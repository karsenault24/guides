ASCC MPPW
----------

The ASCC has a web-based data platform, the Material Process-Property Warehouse (MPPW), available for researchers that have manufacturing process data and material test data.

- MPPW can be used for:

    - Planning

    - Organizing

    - Storing

    - Analysis

The MPPW is made up of an API backed by MongoDB and hosted on a nginx web server. The user interface (UI) is backed by the API, along with an analysis sandbox backed by JupyterHub.

The MPPW is free for ASCC researchers to use. 

CUI and federally regulated data should not be used in MPPW. For more information and resources for CUI and sensitive data please contact the change control board:
